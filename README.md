Simplified Blackjack game:
- Player starts with an initial amount of money set by their input.
- At the start of each round, Player must place a bet.
- Player and Dealer start with 2 cards. The Dealer's second card is initially hidden.
- The player can choose to pick one more card or stop.
- If Player has one or more Ace, and their score would exceed 21, the Ace's value is set to 1 instead of 11.
- If Player's score is more than 21, Player busts and loses the round.
- If Player stops, the Dealer will show their second hand and keep picking cards until their score is at least 17.
